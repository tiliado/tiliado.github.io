<h2 id="about-nuvola-player">About Nuvola Player</h2>
<p><strong>Nuvola Player</strong> is a runtime for web-based music streaming services providing more native user
experience and integration with Linux desktop environments than usual web browsers can offer.
It tries to feel and look like a native application as possible. However, it cannot overcome common
drawbacks of web-based music streaming: some music streaming services require Flash plugin and web
apps usually have higher memory usage than native apps.</p>
<h2 id="news">What's New</h2>
<p>Nuvola Player 3 has been rewritten from scratch and contains plenty of improvements over Nuvola
Player 2.</p>
<h3 id="no-hacks-for-flash-support">No Hacks for Flash Support</h3>
<p>Nuvola Player 2 uses graphical toolkit GTK+ version 3 for its user interface, while Adobe Flash,
Gnash and Lightspark use GTK+ version 2. The old GTK+ 2 and the new GTK+ 3 are not compatible,
so they cannot live in the same process. The problem is that the first generation WebKitGtk+ web
rendering engine used in Nuvola Player 2 runs plugins in the same process as the rest of the user
interface, so GTK+ 2 based Flash plugins cannot be loaded without conflicts with GTK+ 3.</p>
<p><strong>Nuvola Player 2 has to employ an ugly hack to support Flash</strong>: run the Flash plugin in its own
non-conflicting process via nspluginwrapper. However, this approach has several disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>nspluginwrapper only supports only 32bit Flash plugin. As a result, you have to install hundreds
    of 32bit libraries on you 64bit system to be able to run 32bit Flash plugin. Yes, this is
    insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory usage is higher and performance is lower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wrapped Flash plugin is less stable, it often crashes and takes down whole Nuvola Player
    2 application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nuvola Player 3 doesn't need any hacks to support Flash plugin</strong>, because it is built on top of
WebKit2Gtk+, the second generation of this web rendering library.
The major diference is that plugins are run in a separate GTK+ 2 compatible process, so there is no
need to use nspluginwrapper and install 32bit libraries on 64bit system. There is also one extra
benefit: If Flash plugin crashes, it doesn't take down whole Nuvola Player application.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="independent-instances">Independent Instances</h3>
<p>It was possible to have only one instance of <strong>Nuvola Player 2</strong> shared by all streaming services
and switch between them. In <strong>Nuvola Player 3</strong>, it's possible to run multiple services side-by-side
(<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nuvola-player/+bug/1007185">feature request</a>).
The services selector launches new instance for each service and creates a desktop application
shortcut (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nuvola-player/+bug/1211351">feature request</a>)
when a particular service starts. As a result, you can than pin it to the Unity Launcher or
GNOME Activities dock and launch it directly in the future.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="tiliado-repository">Tiliado Repository</h3>
<p>While Nuvola Player 2 repository provided packages only for Ubuntu and Debian, Nuvola Player 3
brings official support and packages also for Fedora. However, the Fedora packages may be
discontinued if there isn't enough financial support from Fedora users to justify existence of these
packages.</p>
<p>As I have received many complains that installation of Nuvola Player 2 was not easy enough for less
experienced users, I've created a graphical installer specially designed for them. However, power
users can of course still add Nuvola Player repository to software sources manually using terminal
kung-fu. The graphical installer is pretty handy though and I always use it when I test Nuvola
Player in clean systems in VirtualBox ;-)</p>
<p>Since I dislike the short nine-month support window of interim Ubuntu releases and their consecutive
removal from Launchpad build machines, I decided to abandon Launchpad and host APT repository on my
server like I did so with the repository for Debian. A side benefit is that packages won't get stuck
in Launchpad build queue. In addition, RPM packages for Fedora are also hosted on this server, all
in one place.</p>
<h3 id="new-codebase">New Codebase</h3>
<p>Since Nuvola Player 3 codebase was written from scratch, it doesn't have to carry a huge bag of backward
compatibility, which limited improvements in Nuvola Player 2, and it's easier to use new technologies.
Consequently, Nuvola Player 3 uses header bar with client side decorations and App Menu in GNOME,
but classic window decorations and global menu bar in Unity. Also, JavaScript API for service integration
scripts has been reworked to be more flexible.</p>
<h3 id="other-changes">Other changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added manager of keyboard shortcuts
    (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nuvola-player/+bug/1294082">feature request</a>) and added support
    for <strong>global keyboard shortcuts</strong>
    (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nuvola-player/+bug/1200911">feature request</a>). You can,
    for example, define a keyboard shortcut to show currently playing track in notification
    (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nuvola-player/+bug/1207926">feature request</a>)</li>
<li>Menu bar has been replaced with <strong>header bar</strong> (with client-side decorations in GNOME).</li>
<li><strong>Command line interface</strong> has been reworked. See <code>nuvolaplayer3ctl --help</code>. It is no possible to
    invoke toggle and radio actions (e.g. thumbs up/down, star rating;
    <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nuvola-player/+bug/1084145">feature request</a>)</li>
<li>Unity Quick list integration was enhanced to show state of toggle actions (e.g. thumbs up/down,
    <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nuvola-player/+bug/1081077">feature request</a>) and radio actions
    (e.g. star rating)</li>
<li>Queue page of Google Play Music is not used as a start-up page
    (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/nuvola-player/+bug/1306678">feature request</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="streaming-services">Streaming Services</h2>
<p>On August 22nd 2016, Nuvola Player 3 shipped with 16 music streaming services.
See <a href="https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/">Nuvola Player hompage</a> for more up-to-date list.</p>

<h2 id="missing-features">Missing Features</h2>
<p>Since I didn't want to postpone release of Nuvola Player 3 again and again, I decided not to
implement some features available in Nuvola Player 2 for now. As a result, following features are
missing in Nuvola Player 3 and might be added later upon demand from users: Libre.fm scrobbling,
translations and file downloads. </p>
<h2 id="limited-support-and-commercial-support">Limited Support and Commercial Support</h2>
<p>Nuvola Player 3 project provides free support on best-effort basis without any guarantees.
Officially supported distributions include <a href="./install.html#ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> 14.04, 15.04, 15.10, 16.04 and 16.10,
<a href="./install.html#fedora">Fedora</a> 23-24, and <a href="./install.html#debian">Debian</a> Jessie,
Stretch and Sid. The Nuvola Player developer has tested installation and functionality in clean
virtualized instances of these distributions and can assure reasonable user support in case of
problems. However, Nuvola Player should also work on
<a href="./install.html#other-linux">other modern Linux distributions</a>, but user experience might
not be optimal (e.g. inconsistent look and behavior) and quality of user support depends on
complexity of an issue.</p>
<p>If free support on best-effort basic is not sufficient, you can contract the Nuvola Player developer
for a commercial support.</p>
<h2 id="project-funding">Project Funding</h2>
<p>My work on Nuvola Player is <a href="https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/funding/">funded by Nuvola Patrons</a>.
My dream is to work as an independent developer on open source software for all people around the
world, software for you. If you like Nuvola Player, or even use it every day, you can
<a href="https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/funding/">show your gratitude by supporting the project</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you and happy listening!</p>
